= ACE base image

ACE base image used to build BAR-files and run ACE integration server.

Base image is automatically built when new commit is pushed to the base-branch.

Base-image and base-branch is provided because installing ACE Developer Edition requires downloading a file from IBM site and extracting it. By providing base-image, download happens only when base-image is updated.

When updating Dockerfile, remember to checkout base-branch and push to repository.
