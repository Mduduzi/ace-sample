= IBM App Connect Enterprise - integration application in a container
:toc: left
:toc-title: Table of Contents

This repository includes sample integration application built with https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/app-connect/12.0?topic=overview-app-connect-enterprise-toolkit[IBM App Connect Enterprise Toolkit] and Dockerfile(s) to run the integration application in a container. Samples how to deploy the container to OpenShift is also provided.

== Purpose

The purpose of this repo, the integration application and Dockerfile is to provide an example how a single integration application can be provided as container image and how to configure container using environment variables. 

Use this repo as an example how to create a container from your own ACE-project(s).

This repo provides one example, but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it[there is more than one way to do it].


== Application

The application is a very simple integration with HTTP input interface that outputs JSON message or transforms input field to output field. The application is based on https://github.com/ot4i/http-input-tutorial[an existing sample].

Sample commands and output:

```
>curl http://localhost:7800
{"message":"Hello world!"}

>curl -d '{\"input1\":\"hello\",\"input2\":\"world\"}' http://localhost:7800/
{"output1":"hello","output2":"world","message":"Hello world!"}
```

== Development

The application and container in this repo are developed using the following assumptions:

* IBM App Connect Enterprise version is 12.x.
* IBM App Connect Enterprise is the developer edition.
** Note that https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/app-connect/12.0?topic=mode-operation-modes#ae67700___developer[developer edition is limited to one message per second].
* Integration application development is done using ACE toolkit in developer workstation.
* All development is done in developer workstation.
** Integration server for testing runs inside toolkit.
* All integration application artifacts are inside single project.
** Sample project is in link:ace-sample-app/[ace-sample-app]-directory.
* Developer does not build bar-file, nor deploy application to external server.
* Developer is responsible for writing the Dockerfile.
* Developer is responsible for application and ACE lifecycle, updating when required.

== Container

There are two Dockerfiles in this repository:

* link:ace-base-image/Dockerfile[ace-base-image/Dockerfile] is the base image.
** Downloads and extracts ACE Developer edition (from http://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/websphere/integration/).
*** Version is given in the Dockerfile
** Updates the Red Hat UBI base image.
* link:Dockerfile[Dockerfile] is the main image and it uses the base image.
** Sets up ACE, adds application sources and other files.
** It is based on https://github.com/ot4i/ace-docker.

The final entry in the Dockerfile is CMD that calls the link:start.sh[start.sh]-script.

The link:start.sh[start.sh]-script does the following every time the container starts:

* Initializes ACE environment.
* Sets up admin authentication, if ACE_ENABLE_ADMIN_AUTHENTICATION environment variable is set.
* Creates bar-file.
* Overrides properties in bar-file, if properties are given in _ACE_PROPERTY_OVERRIDES_ environment variable.
* Installs bar-file to integration server in the container.
* Starts the integration server.

See link:start.sh[start.sh] for more details.

Note that link:ace-base-image/Dockerfile[ace-base-image/Dockerfile] and link:Dockerfile[Dockerfile] can be combined in a single Dockerfile.

== Usage

* Download/clone this repository.
* Build container:
```
docker build -t acesample .
```
* Run container in foreground:
```
docker run -it --rm -p 7800:7800 -p 7600:7600 acesample
```
* The admin dashboard runs on port 7600. Do not expose that port if dashboard access is not needed.
* Access the integration application in the container.
** Use browser or curl:
```
curl http://localhost:7800
```
* Set environment variables during startup, for example:
```
docker run -it --rm -p 7800:7800 -p 7600:7600 -e ACE_PROPERTY_OVERRIDES=SampleFlow#message="Hello there!" acesample

docker run -it --rm -p 7800:7800 -p 7600:7600 -e ACE_ENABLE_ADMIN_AUTHENTICATION=true -e ACE_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD=passw0rd acesample

```
* _ACE_PROPERTY_OVERRIDES_ variable includes comma-separated list of configurable properties. 
* Access admin dashboard:
** http://localhost:7600
* Sample container is also available from Dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kazhar/ace-sample.

== Environment variables

.Environment variables that can be used when starting the container.
|===
|Name|Value|Default|Description

|ACE_APPNAME
|<any string>
|integration-application
|Application name. Application is installed in _/home/aceuser/$ACE_APPNAME_-directory in the container. Application name is also visible in admin dashboard.

|ACE_PROPERTY_OVERRIDES
|<comma-separated list of of configurable properties>
|
|Configurable properties must be included in the integration application during development. For example, to change the default message in output JSON, the value is ```SampleFlow#message="Hello there!"```. See https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/app-connect/12.0?topic=common-mqsiapplybaroverride-command for syntax of properties.

|ACE_ENABLE_ADMIN_AUTHENTICATION
|true
|
|If true, sets up authentication to admin dashboard.

|ACE_ADMIN_USER_NAME
|<any string>
|admin
|Admin user name.

|ACE_ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD
|<any string>
|
|Admin user password. Must be set if ACE_ENABLE_ADMIN_AUTHENTICATION is true.

|ACE_START_BASH
|true
|
|If true, bash-shell is started instead of integration server when container is started.

== OpenShift

The sample ACE container is easily installed to OpenShift-cluster: link:openshift/README.adoc[examples how to deploy to OpenShift].
